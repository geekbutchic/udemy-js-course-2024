// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI, which is calculated using this Formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
2. Calculate both their BMI's using the formula (you can even implement both versions).
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBmi' containing information about whether mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test Data 1 :
* Marks weighs 78kg and is 1.69m tall.  
* John weighs 92kg and is 1.95m tall.

Test Data 2 :
* Mark weighs 95kg and is 1.88m tall.
* John weighs 85kg and is 1.76m tall.
