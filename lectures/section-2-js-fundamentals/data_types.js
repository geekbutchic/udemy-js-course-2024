// 3 Most common Primitive Value Types

//Number
let age = 23;
console.log(typeof age, age);

//String
let firstName = "Sonny";
console.log(typeof firstName, firstName);

//Boolean
let javascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun, javascriptIsFun);

//Changing a value in JS showing dynamic typing
javascriptIsFun = "true";
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun, javascriptIsFun); //string true

//To Note: when re-assigning a new variable you do not have to use let or const.  let or const would be an indication of creating a new variable.
